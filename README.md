# Homologue Analysis

A look across multiple animal species to identify genes that exist in homo sapiens but may be missing in other animals. 

## Heat Map

We can visualize the percentage identity of genes across animal species. A gene is queried in the ensembl database for its homologues and then calculates the percentage identity compared to homo sapiens. The percentage indicates the sequence similarity across species for the same gene.
