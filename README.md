# Homologue Analysis

A look across multiple animal species to identify genes that exist in homo sapiens but may be missing in other animals. 

## Heat Map

We can visualize the percentage identity of genes across animal species. A gene is queried in the ensembl database for it's homologues and then calculates the percentage identity compared to homo sapiens. The percentage indictages how similiar the gene sequence is.
